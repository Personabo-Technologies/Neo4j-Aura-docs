# Querying an instance

</div>

<div>

You can query data in an AuraDB instance using Cypher.

Cypher is the declarative graph query language created by Neo4j and can
be used to query, update, and administer your AuraDB instance.

</div>

<div>

You can run Cypher statements through Neo4j Browser and Neo4j Cypher
Shell. For more information on how to open an AuraDB instance in Browser
and Cypher Shell, see Connecting to an instance.
