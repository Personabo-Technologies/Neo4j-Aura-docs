# Creating an AuraDS instance

</div>

<div>

1.  Navigate to the Neo4j Aura Console.

2.  Select **Create an instance** to open the **Create an instance**
    page.

3.  Set the **Instance details**:

    <div>

    -   **Instance Name** - The name to give to the instance. A
        descriptive name makes it easier to find a specific instance
        among many.

    -   **Number of nodes/relationships** - The estimated number of
        nodes and relationships that the instance should support.

    </div>

4.  Select one or more algorithm categories from the **Which algorithms
    are you going to use?** section (or the **I'm not sure yet** option)
    to help estimate the most appropriate instance size. An overview of
    each algorithm category can be found here.

5.  Select **Calculate Estimate** to get an estimate of the resources
    needed to run the graph (memory, CPU, storage) along with the
    expected price.

6.  Select **Create Instance** to proceed.

7.  Copy and store the **Username** and **Generated password**
    credentials to access the instance just created. Alternatively, you
    can download the credentials as a `.txt` file.

    <div>

    <div>

    <table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<i></i>
</td>
<td>
<strong>Warning</strong>: Make sure that the username and password are stored safely before continuing. Credentials cannot be recovered afterwards.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

    </div>

    </div>

8.  Tick the **I have stored these credentials safely to use later**
    checkbox and select **Continue**.

</tbody></table>

</div>

</div>

The process will take a few minutes to complete. Upon completion, you
will be able to connect to the instance.
