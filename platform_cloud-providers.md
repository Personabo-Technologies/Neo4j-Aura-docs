### 1. Purchase the service

<div>

To get started, visit the Neo4j Aura for GCP Marketplace page and click
**Purchase**. Note that you won't be billed until you create a database,
so purchasing Neo4j Aura on GCP just gets you started.

</div>

<div>

<div>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<i></i>
</td>
<td>
<div>
<p>Purchasing from the GCP marketplace requires the <code>Billing Account Administrator (roles/billing.admin)</code> role as highlighted in the <a>Overview of Cloud Billing access control</a> Google Cloud documentation.</p>
</div>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

</div>

</div>

### 2. Choose a project

<div>

If you purchase the service at the top level of your GCP account, you'll
need to choose a target project. You will only need to *purchase* Neo4j
Aura for GCP once, as you can then enable it on a project-by-project
basis. However, you still need to choose a target project when you first
purchase the service.

</div>

### 3. Enable the service

<div>

Once you have purchased the service and switched to a target project,
you will get the option to *Enable* the service for that project. Click
**Enable** to activate Neo4j Aura for GCP on your project.

</div>

<div>

<div>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<i></i>
</td>
<td>
<div>
<p>Enabling a service through GCP requires the <code>roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin</code> role as highlighted in the <a>Access Control with IAM</a> Google Cloud documentation.</p>
</div>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

</div>

</div>

<div>

Once you have enabled the service, you will be directed to the **Neo4j
Aura for GCP API** page. This page displays your service details and
billing information. When this is first set up, you should have no
billing history.

</div>

### 4. Completing the set up

<div>

To start a database, you can now get to the Neo4j Aura website by
clicking **MANAGE VIA NEO4J, INC.**.

</div>

<div>

<div>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<i></i>
</td>
<td>
<div>
<p>When you click "MANAGE VIA NEO4J, INC.", you will be alerted that "Youâ€™re leaving Google".
When you click <strong>Confirm</strong>, if the Neo4j Aura website fails to open you may need to address any popup blockers in your browser and try again.</p>
</div>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

</div>

</div>

<div>

For security purposes, Neo4j and GCP do not share your login
credentials. You will need to log in to the Neo4j Aura website with the
Google account you have used on GCP.

</div>

<div>

Once logged-in, you'll be asked to accept the Neo4j Aura Terms of
Service, before being directed to the Neo4j Aura dashboard. From here,
you are ready to create a Neo4j Aura database hosted on GCP. Usage will
be billed directly to your GCP billing account.
