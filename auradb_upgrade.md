# Updates and upgrades

AuraDB does not have any scheduled maintenance windows. It is designed
to be always on and available, with all corrections, fixes, and upgrades
automatically applied in the background.

Releases for the Neo4j database are also deployed when they become
available. Operations are non-disruptive, and you shouldn't experience
any downtime as a result.
