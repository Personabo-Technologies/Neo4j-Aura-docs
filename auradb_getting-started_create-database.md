To create an **AuraDB Free** instance in Neo4j AuraDB:

</div>

<div>

1.  Navigate to the Neo4j Aura Console in your browser.

2.  Select **New Instance** to open the **Create an instance** page.

3.  Select **AuraDB Free** as your **Instance type**.

4.  Set your **Instance details**:

    <div>

    -   **Instance Name** - The name to give the instance. This name can
        be whatever you like.

    -   **Region** - The physical location of the instance. Set this as
        close to your location as possible. The closer the region to
        your location, the faster the response time for any network
        interactions with the instance.

    </div>

5.  (Optional) Select a **Starting dataset**. Selecting a starting
    dataset pre-populates your instance with data from the selected
    dataset.

    details.

    credentials for the instance.
