<div>

User management is a feature within Aura that allows you to invite users
and set their roles within an isolated environment.

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div>

## Tenants

<div>

<div>

Tenants are the primary mechanism for granting users access to an Aura
environment.

</div>

<div>

The tenant you're currently viewing is displayed in the header of the
Console. You can select the tenant name to open the **Tenant Dropdown**
menu, which allows you to view the *Tenant ID*.

</div>

<div>

It is possible to be a member of multiple tenants, in which case the
**Tenant Dropdown** will also display the other tenants you have access
to. You can switch between these tenants by clicking on the individual
tenant from the **Tenant Dropdown**.

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div>

## Team members

<div>

<div>

Each tenant consists of a single team that allows multiple users with
individual accounts to access the same environment.

</div>

<div>

The team and its members can be viewed and managed from the **Team
Members** page. You can access the **Team Members** page by selecting
**Team Members** from the sidebar menu of the Console.

</div>

<div>

### Roles

Users within a team can have one of two roles, *Admin* or *Member*.
